<p>So this was pretty helpful for most people last year and here it is again:</p>
<p>If you're flying into Geneva be sure to take one of the transportation passes from the machines before leaving the baggage claim area. This is good for an hour or so. </p>
<p>There are several ways to CERN but I think the easiest route to follow is to find the train platform and hop on any train there. They all go towards the train station (Gare Cornavin) and that will be the first stop. If you're arriving to Geneva on train you're maybe already here.</p>
<p>At Gare Cornavin, you want to head to the ground level and hop on the first shuttle that say's #18 CERN. This will be the last stop, should take maybe 20-25 minutes and you'll be there!</p>
<p>While you're here you can also find the transportation office and buy your monthly pass. It's something like 40 CHF if you're under 25, and is good for all trams, trains, buses, and fairies in the canton of Geneva. If you plan on leaving the CERN campus a few times (and you should) it pays for itself very quickly. </p>
<p>Head to the security gate and have some sort of ID or confirmation to show them that you are a summer student. Most the guards speak very little english if any so the better prepared you are the less you need to talk :) </p>
<p>Lastly, here's something of interest to everyone, it's a route planner that will show you how to get places and what trams or buses to take :) </p>

<p>I'll arrive on June 23rd. I organized many of the parties last year so I'll see if we can't organize one for you around the time most of you will have arrived - seems like around July 1st. Looking forward to meeting you all!</p>
