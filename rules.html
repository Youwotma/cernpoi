            <li>The information is provided by users, it might be inaccurate or wrong.</li>
            <li>Always obey the <a href="https://espace.cern.ch/Safety-Rules-Regulations/en/Pages/default.aspx">CERN safety rules</a>, specially the
            <a href="https://espace.cern.ch/Safety-Rules-Regulations/en/rules/byDomain/Pages/radiationProtection.aspx">Radiation Protection safety rules</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Respect any signals and traffic signs that you encounter. Respect the velocity limits in the road and in any case, always circulate below the speed of light.</li>
            <li>Use your common sense. If you go to a clearly marked dangerous area without protection because "you read on a website that it was OK", you only have yourself to blame.</li>
            <li>Don't be an asshole. Make sure you do not disturb people while they are doing science.</li>
